        <h1> Blood of a Royal</h1>
        <h2> Chapter 1</h2>
            <p> 
                The cold marble flooring of the Greaat Hall was uncomfortable below Elvira's right knee as
                she knelt before her King's throne. She gripped the handle of the ceremonial sword in her hands,
                pressing the lip into the dark blue cushion placed in front of her. The King was yet to make an
                appearance and Elvira took the opportunity to study the sword she was so carefully holding; she 
                had seen it before but never so close. The hilt was a deep red in colour, whith the pommel 
                decorated with blood rubies, mined from the Kingdom of Tamaria. The blade was carved with 
                intricate details; telling the story of the first King of Pallau slaying the great Wyvern, 
                Fenlake the Red, which threw the newly founded country into a great boom, benefitting al.
                Elvira knew the sword she held in her hands was over seven hundred years old and was only 
                brought out for knighting ceremonies like this.
