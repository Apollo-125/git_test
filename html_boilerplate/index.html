                Within this section is the use of <strong> strong </strong>which can be created with
                &lt;strong&gt; which places emphasis for accesibility/screen ready purposes.
            </p>
        <h1> This is the second title of the webpage</h1>
            <p> 
                Within this section we can demonstrate <em> the use of italics</em> to further demonsrate how
                to semantically place emphasiss on any word/s using &lt;em&gt;.
