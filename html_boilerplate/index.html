                Within this section we can also <strong> emphasise strong areas</strong>. This can be achieved using 
                the &lt;strong&gt; tag in order to indicate for any screen accesibility purposes that this must be 
                emphasised
            </p>
        <h2> We can also make use of <em>italics to further indicate emphasis</em></h2>
            <p> 
                This would also be used with the &lt;em&gt; tag line for similar purposes.
