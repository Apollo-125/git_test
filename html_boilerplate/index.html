        <h1> This is the title of the Webpage</h1>
            <p> 
                We can demonstrate the use of <strong> strong emphasis</strong> by using the &lt;strong&gt; tag, which enables
                websites to recognise this for accesibility purposes etc
            </p>
        <h2> This is the second heading of the Webpage.
            <p> 
                We can also <em>demonstrate the use of italics</em> to place emphasis on words which may also be used by any screen
                ready or similar. This is done using the &lt;em&gt; tag.
